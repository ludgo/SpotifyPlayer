# SpotifyPlayer

This is a fully educational Android application based on free course materials at Udacity platform. The aim is to provide users with song snippets streamed from Spotify.

## Dependencies

- Picasso `com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2`
- A wrapper for Spotify Web API `com.github.kaaes:spotify-web-api-android:0.2.0`

For development, the newest Android SDK was used. Nowdays, the application is not mantained up to date with the latest Android platform changes.

## Motivation

The app focuses on functionality, audio player integration and master-detail view, rather than on design or UX. See Udacity's [instructions page](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1v4Kv5lSd8-4cs0BW6F24ccA3c1-KDQZG3EV49CUHQys/pub?embedded=true#h.vvxvgd8zz1vj).

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Udacity for providing free access to the course materials prepared in collaboration with Google developer advocates.
